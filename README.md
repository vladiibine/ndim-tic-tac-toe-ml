# ndim-tic-tac-toe-ml
machine learning algorithm to play tic tac toe in n dimensions

At this early stage, the project will contain just geometric formulas that I need for implementing the thing.

"The thing" will most likely be a neural network that can play tic tac toe in more than 2 dimensions. A human player will probably be able to play with the AI in 3 dimensions, but since this is designed with an arbitrary number in mind, i guess humans will just have to sit this one out at some point.
